# Chart.js
Chart.js is a free, open-source JavaScript library for data visualization, which supports eight chart types: bar, line, area, pie, bubble, radar, polar, and scatter.

This is a JavaScript code that uses Chart.js library to create a bar chart that shows the population of the largest cities in Massachusetts. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1.  The first line retrieves the canvas element with the ID "myChart" and creates a 2D context for it.
2.  The next few lines set some global options for the chart, such as the font family, size, and color.
3.  A new instance of Chart is created, passing in the canvas context and an object with the chart configuration.
4.  The "type" property of the configuration object specifies that this is a bar chart.
5.  The "data" property of the configuration object contains the chart data, which consists of an array of labels (the city names) and a single dataset with the population data for each city.
6.  The dataset has a label ("Population"), an array of population values, and some styling options for the bars (background color, border color, etc.).
7.  The "options" property of the configuration object contains additional options for the chart, such as responsiveness and the configuration for the x and y axes.
8.  The x-axis has a title with some styling options, and the y-axis has a title with no text and some styling options.

When the code is executed, it will create a bar chart that displays the population of the largest cities in Massachusetts, with each bar representing a city and its height representing its population.
